# my-firefox-config
A config that tweaks Firefox to be more private and look cleaner

# user.js tweaks

The user.js is derived from [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js), with personal modifications
I try to always update mine when upstream gets updated

# Theme tweaks

The theme files are from [uc.css.js by aminomancer](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js) and [firefox-csshacks by MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks), with some of my own modifications added on top of them
